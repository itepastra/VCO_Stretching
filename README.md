# VCO_Stretching

This Repo is still a work in progress,

The rest of the code will be added when I've cleaned it up for others. If you want a specific piece of code right ASAP, create an issue.

## Figures

figures are available in the repo, most of the used figures are located in VCO_diode_stretch/figures/
4 rounds of measurements were done, meas_3 and meas_4 are the only measurements that support all features.

## Data

The raw data is available as a txt file with `\t` seperated entries in VCO_diode_stretch/measurements.
The prep.py program processes this raw data into multiple .csv files located in VCO_diode_stretch/data, this is the data used in the paper.
